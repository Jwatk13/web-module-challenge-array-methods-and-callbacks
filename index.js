/*CODE BREAKDOWN: first we have our HOF with 2 parameters, one for original object and the other for task 2 callback function.
next we set up our new object called winners. This is equal to our callback function.map and we are mapping what we call wins.
In this situation since our object key is a string with more than one word, we use bracket notation in place of dot notation.
The greater than symbol compares our two object keys. 
The question mark symbol is in place of an if statement. while the colon symbol is in place of an 'else'
It would be similar to saying: if (wins['Home Team Goals'] > wins['Away Team Goals']) {
    return wins['Home Team Name'];
} else {
    return  wins['Away Team Name'];
}
Next we just return our new object called winners 
Remember to get used to using different notation for different situations, not everything takes the same notation*/
